I think it's time to teach new players how to play the game, so let's get into it!
Abilities

Let's start with the character's abilities: the Ult, Echo, Skill, Gadget, Forte Circuit, and Concerto Energy. These are the primary abilities for each character. If you're wondering about the small circular icon, that's the lock-on feature.
Concerto Energy / Outro / Intro

Concerto Energy is a resource that needs to be filled to use certain abilities. You gain this energy by performing attacks or other actions in battle. Once the gauge is full, you can cast an ability called an Outro Skill by swapping to another character.

Outro Skills have specific benefits. For example, one character's Outro Skill might amplify the next character's basic attack damage by 38%. Generally, Outro Skills amplify all characters’ damage by 15%, but the exact effect varies by character. For DPS-focused characters, Outro Skills often deal direct damage.

After using an Outro Skill, the character you swap into will automatically cast their Intro Skill. This usually deals damage but can have additional effects. For instance, one character's Intro Skill might fill their Forte Circuit. Now that you understand the basics, let me quickly demonstrate:

    Use attacks to fill the Concerto Energy bar.
    Once full, swap to another character.
    The Outro Skill activates, granting its buffs, and the new character’s Intro Skill is cast automatically.

Some characters charge their Concerto Energy faster than others, so experiment to find what works best for your team.
Forte Circuit

The Forte Circuit is the bar located above a character's health bar. This bar is unique to each character and defines their playstyle.

For example:

    One character can only fill their Forte Circuit by casting their Intro Skill. Once the Forte Circuit is full, you’ll see a glowing effect on their icon and a prompt showing how to use it.
    In this case, the Forte Circuit is tied to left-click attacks, which grant stacks that boost her damage. Other characters might fill their Forte Circuit through regular attacks, skills, or Ultimates.

Let’s see how it works:

    Fill the Concerto Energy bar.
    Swap to the character whose Intro Skill fills their Forte Circuit.
    Use the Forte Circuit mechanic for that character, such as a heavy attack.

Every Forte Circuit works differently, making each character feel distinct and rewarding to master.
Gadgets

Gadgets are versatile tools that enhance exploration and combat. The default gadget, the Grapple, is excellent for reaching heights or escaping attacks during combat.

You can customize gadgets via the Utilities Menu, where options include:

    A sensor for locating loot.
    A levitator for exploration.
    A gun-like gadget (though it’s not effective in combat and deals minimal damage).

For most situations, the Grapple is the most practical gadget to use.
Skills

Skills are unique to each character. For example:

    One character might have a stance change skill, toggling between grounded mode (good for single targets) and aerial mode (great for area-of-effect attacks).
    Another character might use a healing ability or a damaging skill that builds their Forte Circuit.

Cooldowns vary by character, so learning to manage Skills is crucial.
Echoes

Echoes are equippable items that change gameplay mechanics. Each character can equip a primary Echo (the top slot in the Echo menu) and additional ones for support.

    Echoes provide buffs and unique combat effects. For example, one Echo might increase Havoc Damage and Skill Damage by 12% after transformation.
    The recommended Echoes are typically 4-cost Echoes, as they offer the most benefits.

Experiment with different Echoes to find the best synergy for your team.
Ultimates / Liberation

Ultimates are powerful abilities that require energy to use, similar to Concerto Energy.

    The energy bar for Ultimates fills through attacks and actions, both on-field and off-field (though off-field energy generation is slower).
    When an Ultimate is ready, its icon will glow, and off-field characters will show a checkmark when their Ultimate is charged.

Ultimates vary greatly between characters, offering massive damage, buffs, or utility effects.
Normal, Heavy, and Plunge Attacks

    Normal Attacks: Basic combos you perform by spamming the attack button.
    Heavy Attacks: Hold the attack button to perform a charged attack, with effects varying per character.
    Plunge Attacks: Performed mid-air by pressing or holding the attack button. Some characters have unique plunge mechanics.

Stamina

Stamina is consumed during:

    Climbing and Gliding.
    Dodging or Sprinting in combat.
    Heavy Attacks.

Note: Stamina is not consumed when sprinting outside of combat.
Dodge & Counters

    Perfect Dodges: Dodge just before being hit to trigger invincibility frames (i-frames), with visual and sound cues confirming success.
    Counter Attacks: Follow up a dodge with a normal attack to deal extra damage and transition into your attack combo.

Parries

Certain enemy attacks can be parried by timing your action (normal/heavy attack, skill, or ultimate) as the attack lands. A successful parry will stun the enemy and deal significant stagger damage.
Stagger Bars

The Stagger Bar (white bar under enemy health) can be broken using:

    Parries.
    Dodge Attacks.
    Intro/Outro Skills, Echoes, Forte, and Ultimates.

Breaking the Stagger Bar leaves enemies vulnerable, allowing you to deal significant damage.
Quick Swapping

Quick Swapping lets you cancel long animations by switching characters mid-action. This allows you to:

    Continue dealing damage with another character.
    Optimize your team’s synergy.

For example, you can use a long animation skill, swap to another character, and still benefit from the off-field animation.
Closing Thoughts
