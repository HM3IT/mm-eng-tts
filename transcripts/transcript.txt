I think it's time to teach new players how to play the game, so let's get into it!
Abilities

Let's start with the character's abilities: the Ult, Echo, Skill, Gadget, Forte Circuit, and Concerto Energy. These are the primary abilities for each character. If you're wondering about the small circular icon, that's the lock-on feature.
Concerto Energy / Outro / Intro

Concerto Energy is a resource that needs to be filled to use certain abilities. You gain this energy by performing attacks or other actions in battle. Once the gauge is full, you can cast an ability called an Outro Skill by swapping to another character.
